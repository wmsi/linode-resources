Here you can find development work for the wmsinh.org home page and the subdomain pages. 
Right now almost all the subdomain index pages (e.g. berlin.wmsinh.org/index.html) immediately redirect to the gallery page for that subdomain. We did some testing with carousel-template.html as a home page for each subdomain- it could include feature stories from these Mobile programs, bios for the youth leaders, writing from students in that town, and a link to the gallery. Obviously all of this would take a bit of work to maintain.

Below is the original README that came with the cover page template.
