<h2>Welcome to WMSI Linode Resources!</h2> 
<p>Here you can find most of the development resources for our Linode-hosted server, wmsinh.org. This server was set up in late 2017 as a testing place for web development projects. Someday it may become the hosting platform for our main site. The projects you'll find in this repository are:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Web page source code for the pages hosted on our server</li>
		<li>Source code for our Internet of Things window example</li>
		<li>Source code for our image uploader and image gallery generator</li>
	</ol>

<p>If you don't see something you're looking for, or you want a little more explanation as to what this is all about, check out our <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B1AHc4nB2EhYdlJ4Zk8taHpfYkE">google drive docs!</a></p>

<h4>Heads up! The folder/ file structure ins this repository <b>does not</b> match the structure on the Linode. For the folder structure of the Linode and information flow of wmsinh.org check out the Lucidchart's linked in the Google Docs above.</h4>
